    "Q1.\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, known as the parent or base class. The class that inherits these properties and behaviors is called the child or derived class. Inheritance forms an \"is-a\" relationship, where the derived class is a specialized version of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is used to promote code reusability, extensibility, and modularity in object-oriented programming. It allows developers to define common attributes and methods in a base class and then create derived classes that inherit those characteristics. By doing so, the derived classes automatically possess the attributes and behaviors of the base class, reducing code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key benefits of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Inheritance enables the reuse of existing code. By defining common properties and behaviors in a base class, derived classes can inherit and use them without re-implementing the same code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Derived classes can extend the functionality of the base class by adding new properties and methods or by overriding existing ones. This allows developers to create specialized classes that inherit the general characteristics of the base class while introducing their specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Inheritance promotes modular design by allowing classes to be organized hierarchically. By creating a class hierarchy based on inheritance relationships, it becomes easier to understand and manage the relationships between different classes in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely tied to the concept of polymorphism. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This flexibility allows for writing code that can work with different derived classes interchangeably, enhancing code flexibility and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, inheritance is a powerful mechanism in object-oriented programming that promotes code reuse, extensibility, and modular design. It provides a way to model real-world relationships between objects and enhances the overall structure and organization of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.\n",
    "Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their\n",
    "\n",
    "differences and advantages.\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, known as the parent or base class. There are two types of inheritance: single inheritance and multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "Single inheritance refers to the process of inheriting properties and behaviors from a single base class. In this type of inheritance, a derived class extends the functionality of a single base class. The derived class inherits all the members (variables and methods) of the base class and can add its own unique members or override the inherited ones.\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance is relatively simple and easy to understand since there is only one parent class involved.\n",
    "Encapsulation: Single inheritance promotes encapsulation by allowing the derived class to access the public and protected members of the base class.\n",
    "Code Reusability: By inheriting from a single base class, the derived class can reuse the code and functionality defined in the base class, reducing code duplication.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "Multiple inheritance refers to the process of inheriting properties and behaviors from multiple base classes. In this type of inheritance, a derived class can inherit from more than one base class. The derived class gains the combined features of all the base classes, allowing it to exhibit behaviors from multiple sources.\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Functionality: Multiple inheritance allows a class to combine features and behaviors from multiple parent classes, providing a higher degree of flexibility and functionality.\n",
    "Code Reusability: By inheriting from multiple base classes, the derived class can reuse code and functionality from different sources, promoting code reusability.\n",
    "Promotes Modularity: Multiple inheritance can help in creating modular code structures by allowing classes to specialize in specific behaviors through different base classes.\n",
    "Differences between Single Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Base Classes: Single inheritance involves inheriting from a single base class, whereas multiple inheritance involves inheriting from multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Single inheritance is simpler and easier to understand compared to multiple inheritance, which can introduce more complexity and potential conflicts when combining features from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamond Problem: Multiple inheritance introduces the diamond problem, which occurs when a derived class inherits from two or more base classes that have a common base class. This can lead to ambiguity and conflicts in method and attribute resolution, requiring additional measures such as virtual inheritance to resolve the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity: Single inheritance provides a more granular and specialized approach by extending the functionality of a single class. Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit and combine features from multiple classes simultaneously, leading to broader functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while multiple inheritance offers more flexibility, it can also make the code more complex and harder to maintain. It should be used judiciously to ensure code readability and to avoid potential conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.\n",
    "Explain the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" in the context of inheritance.\n",
    "In the context of inheritance, the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" are used to describe the relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A base class, also known as a superclass or parent class, is a class that serves as the starting point for creating other classes. It defines common attributes and behaviors that can be inherited by other classes. The base class encapsulates the fundamental characteristics and functionalities that are shared by its derived classes. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects and provides a foundation for more specialized classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a derived class, also known as a subclass or child class, is a class that inherits properties and behaviors from a base class. It extends the functionality of the base class by adding new attributes and methods or by modifying existing ones. The derived class can access and use all the public and protected members of the base class, and it can override or extend these members as needed. In other words, a derived class is a specialization of the base class, tailored to meet specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows for code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes. By defining common features in a base class and inheriting from it, derived classes can inherit and build upon the characteristics of the base class while adding their own unique features. This helps in creating modular, maintainable, and scalable code structures in object-oriented programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, the \"protected\" access modifier plays a significant role in inheritance. It allows access to members (methods and variables) of a class not only within the class itself but also within its derived classes or subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier, let's briefly discuss the differences between the three access modifiers: \"private,\" \"protected,\" and \"public\":\n",
    "\n",
    "Private: When a member of a class is marked as private, it is only accessible within the same class. Other classes, including derived classes, cannot access private members. Private members are mainly used for encapsulation, ensuring that the internal implementation details of a class are hidden and not accessible from the outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected: Protected members are accessible within the class itself, as well as within its derived classes. In other words, protected members are inherited by subclasses and can be accessed directly from them. However, protected members are not accessible from instances of the class or other unrelated classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public: Public members have the least restrictive access. They can be accessed from anywhere, including within the class, its derived classes, and instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider a scenario where class A is the base class and class B is derived from class A:\n",
    "\n",
    "java\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class A {\n",
    "    private int Private Member;\n",
    "    protected int Protected Member;\n",
    "    public int Public Member;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class B extends A {\n",
    "    // Derived class B can access both protected and public members of class A\n",
    "    void method() {\n",
    "        Protected Member = 10; // Accessible within derived class B\n",
    "        Public Member = 20;    // Also accessible within derived class B\n",
    "        // Private Member = 30; // Not accessible from derived class B\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "In this example, the protected member Protected Member is accessible within class B because it is inherited from class A. Class B can directly access and modify the protected member. However, the private member privateMember is not accessible from class B because it is marked as private within class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protected access modifier allows for the implementation of inheritance hierarchies, where derived classes can access and extend the behavior of their base classes while still maintaining encapsulation. It provides a balance between encapsulation and inheritance, allowing subclasses to have controlled access to inherited members.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that different programming languages may have slightly different rules and variations in how access modifiers work, but the general concepts remain similar across most object-oriented languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, the \"super\" keyword is used to refer to the parent class or superclass. It allows you to access and invoke the superclass's methods, constructors, and variables from within the subclass. The \"super\" keyword is commonly used when you want to extend a superclass and add specific behavior or attributes in the subclass, while still retaining the functionality of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the purpose of the \"super\" keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal {\n",
    "   protected String name;\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   public void eat() {\n",
    "      System.out.println(\"The animal is eating.\");\n",
    "   }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog extends Animal {\n",
    "   private String breed;\n",
    "\n",
    "   public Dog(String name, String breed) {\n",
    "      super(name); // Call the superclass constructor\n",
    "      this.breed = breed;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   public void bark() {\n",
    "      System.out.println(\"The dog is barking.\");\n",

    "\n",
    "   // Override the eat() method from the superclass\n",
    "   public void eat() {\n",
    "      super.eat(); // Call the eat() method of the superclass\n",
    "      System.out.println(\"The dog is eating bones.\");\n",
    "   }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Main {\n",
    "   public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "      Dog dog = new Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Labrador\");\n",
    "      dog.eat(); // Output: The animal is eating. The dog is eating bones.\n",
    "      dog.bark(); // Output: The dog is barking.\n",
    "   }\n",
    "}\n",
    "In this example, we have a superclass called Animal and a subclass called Dog. The Dog class extends the Animal class, inheriting its attributes and methods. The Dog class also has its own unique attribute breed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Dog class constructor, the line super(name); invokes the constructor of the superclass Animal, passing the name of the dog. This initializes the name attribute inherited from the Animal class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eat() method is overridden in the Dog class to provide specific behavior for dogs. In the overridden method, super.eat() is called first, which invokes the eat() method of the superclass Animal. Then, the subclass-specific behavior is added to the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main method, we create an instance of Dog called a dog. When we call dog.eat(), it first invokes the eat() method of the superclass, printing \"The animal is eating.\" Then, it executes the additional code in the eat() method of the Dog class, printing \"The dog is eating bones.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The super keyword allows us to access the superclass's methods and constructors, making it easier to extend and modify the functionality provided by the superclass in the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.\n",
    "Here's an example of how you can create a base class called \"Vehicle\" with attributes like \"make\", \"model\", and \"year\", and then create a derived class called \"Car\" that inherits from \"Vehicle\" and adds an attribute called \"fuel_type\".

    "In this example, the Vehicle class is the base class that contains the common attributes and methods shared by all vehicles.
